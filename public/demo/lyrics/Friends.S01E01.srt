3
00:00:55,469 --> 00:00:59,303
There's nothing to tell.
It's just some guy I work with.

4
00:00:59,506 --> 00:01:01,633
You're going out with the guy.

5
00:01:01,842 --> 00:01:04,436
There has to be something
wrong with him.

6
00:01:04,645 --> 00:01:06,704
All right, Joey.
Be nice.

7
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,405
So does he have a hump
and a hairpiece?

8
00:01:11,218 --> 00:01:13,652
Wait, does he eat chalk?

9
00:01:13,821 --> 00:01:17,120
I don't want her to go through
what I did with Carl.

10
00:01:17,291 --> 00:01:21,387
Okay, everybody relax.
This is not even a date.

11
00:01:21,562 --> 00:01:25,931
It's just two people going out
to dinner and not having sex.

12
00:01:26,166 --> 00:01:29,260
Sounds like a date to me.

13
00:01:31,105 --> 00:01:33,539
I'm in high school,
in the cafeteria...

14
00:01:33,707 --> 00:01:36,938
...and I realize I'm totally naked.

15
00:01:37,144 --> 00:01:38,805
I've had that dream.

16
00:01:39,346 --> 00:01:42,804
Then I look down and I realize
there is a phone...

17
00:01:44,151 --> 00:01:46,244
...there.

18
00:01:47,955 --> 00:01:49,752
-Instead of...
-That's right!

19
00:01:50,157 --> 00:01:51,488
Never had that one.

20
00:01:51,658 --> 00:01:56,254
All of a sudden,
the phone starts to ring.

21
00:01:56,463 --> 00:01:59,455
What do I do?
Everyone starts looking at me.

22
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:02,226
They weren't looking at you before?

23
00:02:03,203 --> 00:02:06,969
Finally, I figure
I'd better answer it.

24
00:02:07,174 --> 00:02:10,974
And it turns out it's my mother.

25
00:02:11,178 --> 00:02:15,137
Which is very, very weird
because she never calls me.

26
00:02:20,354 --> 00:02:22,652
Hi.

27
00:02:24,892 --> 00:02:27,520
He says, "Hello,"
I want to kill myself.

28
00:02:28,629 --> 00:02:29,687
You okay?

29
00:02:30,597 --> 00:02:35,261
I feel like someone pulled my
intestine out of my mouth...

30
00:02:35,469 --> 00:02:39,906
-...and tied it around my neck.
-Cookie?

31
00:02:40,407 --> 00:02:43,001
Carol moved her stuff out today.

32
00:02:43,177 --> 00:02:46,442
-Let me get you some coffee.
-Thanks.

33
00:02:49,816 --> 00:02:54,913
No, don't!
Stop cleansing my aura.

34
00:02:55,122 --> 00:02:59,752
-Just leave my aura alone, okay?
-Fine, be murky.

35
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,850
-I'll be fine. I hope she'll be happy.
-No, you don't.

36
00:03:02,931 --> 00:03:07,332
No, I don't.
To hell with her. She left me!

37
00:03:07,534 --> 00:03:10,298
You never knew she was a lesbian?

38
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,631
No! Okay?

39
00:03:15,909 --> 00:03:18,844
Why does everyone
keep fixating on that?

40
00:03:20,414 --> 00:03:23,941
She didn't know.
How should I know?

41
00:03:24,985 --> 00:03:28,944
Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian.

42
00:03:29,523 --> 00:03:31,718
Did I say that out loud?

43
00:03:33,961 --> 00:03:37,795
I told Mom and Dad last night.
They took it pretty well.

44
00:03:37,998 --> 00:03:38,987
Oh, really?

45
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:42,828
So that hysterical phone call
from a woman sobbing...

46
00:03:43,036 --> 00:03:47,666
..."I'll never have grandchildren,"
was what? A wrong number?

47
00:03:47,908 --> 00:03:48,897
Sorry.

48
00:03:49,109 --> 00:03:52,909
Look, you're feeling
a lot of pain right now.

49
00:03:53,113 --> 00:03:55,741
You're angry.
You're hurting.

50
00:03:55,949 --> 00:03:58,179
Can I tell you what
the answer is?

51
00:03:58,352 --> 00:03:59,649
Strip joints!

52
00:04:01,788 --> 00:04:04,188
Hey, you're single.
Have some hormones.

53
00:04:05,359 --> 00:04:07,589
But I don't want
to be single, okay?

54
00:04:07,794 --> 00:04:11,321
I just want to be married again.

55
00:04:15,502 --> 00:04:19,131
And I just want a million dollars!

56
00:04:22,776 --> 00:04:26,473
-Rachel?
-Oh, Monica! Thank God!

57
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,711
I went to your building...

58
00:04:28,882 --> 00:04:32,648
...and a guy with a hammer
said you'd be here, and you are.

59
00:04:32,819 --> 00:04:36,721
-Can I get you some coffee?
-Decaf.

60
00:04:37,391 --> 00:04:40,792
Everybody, this is Rachel,
a Lincoln High survivor.

61
00:04:40,994 --> 00:04:43,588
This is everybody.
Chandler and Phoebe...

62
00:04:43,764 --> 00:04:45,959
...Joey.
Remember my brother, Ross?

63
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:47,360
Sure!

64
00:04:57,277 --> 00:05:01,941
You want to tell us now, or are we
waiting for four wet bridesmaids?

65
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:07,951
Well, it started about
a half-hour before the wedding.

66
00:05:08,155 --> 00:05:10,817
I was in the room
with all the presents...

67
00:05:11,024 --> 00:05:16,724
...and I was looking at this
really gorgeous Limoges gravy boat.

68
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:18,557
When all of a sudden...

69
00:05:18,765 --> 00:05:19,959
Sweet 'N Low?

70
00:05:22,336 --> 00:05:26,238
I realized I was more turned on by
this gravy boat than Barry.

71
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,307
I got freaked out,
and it hit me:

72
00:05:29,509 --> 00:05:32,307
How much Barry looks
like Mr. Potato Head.

73
00:05:32,979 --> 00:05:36,415
I always knew
he looked familiar, but...

74
00:05:38,785 --> 00:05:42,186
I had to get out of there,
and I started wondering...

75
00:05:42,389 --> 00:05:46,052
..."Why am I doing this,"
and "Who am I doing it for?"

76
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:50,161
I didn't know where to go,
and I know we've drifted apart...

77
00:05:50,831 --> 00:05:53,664
...but you're the only person
I know here.

78
00:05:53,834 --> 00:05:59,204
-Who wasn't invited to the wedding.
-I hoped that wouldn't be an issue.

79
00:06:15,689 --> 00:06:20,592
I guess he bought her the pipe organ,
and she's really not happy about it.

80
00:06:21,228 --> 00:06:23,822
"Tuna or egg salad!
Decide!"

81
00:06:25,365 --> 00:06:30,064
"I'll have whatever
Christina's having."

82
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:33,569
Daddy, I just...
I can't marry him.

83
00:06:34,074 --> 00:06:38,977
I'm sorry.
I just don't love him.

84
00:06:39,179 --> 00:06:43,206
Well, it matters to me!

85
00:06:44,818 --> 00:06:50,347
"If I let go of my hair,
my head will fall off."

86
00:06:51,358 --> 00:06:54,850
She should not be
wearing those pants.

87
00:06:55,061 --> 00:06:56,722
Push her down the stairs!

88
00:06:57,230 --> 00:07:00,097
Push her!
Push her down the stairs!

89
00:07:04,371 --> 00:07:06,999
Come on, Daddy, listen!

90
00:07:07,607 --> 00:07:11,839
All my life, everyone's
always told me, "You're a shoe!"

91
00:07:12,045 --> 00:07:14,479
"You're a shoe!"

92
00:07:14,648 --> 00:07:17,674
What if I don't want to be a shoe?

93
00:07:17,918 --> 00:07:20,944
What if I want to be a purse?

94
00:07:21,154 --> 00:07:23,782
Or a hat?

95
00:07:24,124 --> 00:07:26,524
No, I don't want you
to buy me a hat!

96
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:30,025
It's a metaphor, Daddy!

97
00:07:30,664 --> 00:07:34,122
You can see where he'd have trouble.

98
00:07:35,969 --> 00:07:37,766
Look, Daddy,
it's my life.

99
00:07:39,105 --> 00:07:42,700
Well, maybe I'll just stay
here with Monica.

100
00:07:44,811 --> 00:07:48,144
I guess we've established
she's staying with Monica.

101
00:07:48,682 --> 00:07:51,947
Well, maybe that's my decision.

102
00:07:52,152 --> 00:07:54,347
Maybe I don't need your money.

103
00:07:54,921 --> 00:07:57,754
Wait!
I said maybe!

104
00:08:04,965 --> 00:08:07,832
Just breathe. That's it.

105
00:08:08,001 --> 00:08:10,492
Try to think of nice, calm things.

106
00:08:10,804 --> 00:08:14,296
<i>Raindrops on roses
And whiskers on kittens</i>

107
00:08:14,741 --> 00:08:18,905
<i>Doorbells and sleigh bells
And something with mittens</i>

108
00:08:19,746 --> 00:08:23,443
<i>La la la something
And noodles with string</i>

109
00:08:23,984 --> 00:08:25,713
I'm all better now.

110
00:08:27,587 --> 00:08:30,147
I helped.

111
00:08:31,358 --> 00:08:33,758
This is probably for the best.

112
00:08:34,528 --> 00:08:39,192
Independence. Controlling your life.
The whole hat thing.

113
00:08:39,366 --> 00:08:43,496
You can always come to Joey.

114
00:08:43,703 --> 00:08:47,298
Me and Chandler live across the hall.
He's away a lot.

115
00:08:49,109 --> 00:08:51,771
Stop hitting on her!
It's her wedding day.

116
00:08:52,145 --> 00:08:55,308
Like there's a rule, or something?

117
00:08:57,417 --> 00:08:59,749
I got it.

118
00:08:59,986 --> 00:09:03,478
Please don't do that again.
It's a horrible sound.

119
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:05,314
<i>It's Paul.</i>

120
00:09:05,525 --> 00:09:08,983
Oh, God, is it 6:30?
Buzz him in.

121
00:09:09,162 --> 00:09:11,630
-Who's Paul?
-Paul, the wine guy?

122
00:09:11,831 --> 00:09:12,820
Maybe.

123
00:09:12,999 --> 00:09:16,332
Your "not a real date"
is with Paul, the wine guy?

124
00:09:16,503 --> 00:09:18,994
-He finally asked you out?
-Yes!

125
00:09:19,205 --> 00:09:21,673
It's a "Dear Diary" moment.

126
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:25,311
-Rach, I can cancel.
-Please, go, I'll be fine.

127
00:09:26,713 --> 00:09:30,114
Ross, are you okay?
Do you want me to stay?

128
00:09:30,317 --> 00:09:33,013
That'd be good.

129
00:09:34,254 --> 00:09:38,247
-Really?
-Go on! It's Paul, the wine guy!

130
00:09:38,825 --> 00:09:41,055
Does he sell it, drink it?

131
00:09:41,261 --> 00:09:44,025
Or he just complains a lot?

132
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:46,562
Hi, come in!
Paul, this is...

133
00:09:47,767 --> 00:09:50,292
...everybody.
Everybody, this is Paul.

134
00:09:51,972 --> 00:09:55,840
-The wine guy.
-I didn't catch your name. Paul?

135
00:09:57,544 --> 00:10:00,672
I'll be right back.
I've just gotta go...

136
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,178
A-wandering?

137
00:10:03,383 --> 00:10:04,714
Change.

138
00:10:04,918 --> 00:10:07,352
Sit down.
Two seconds.

139
00:10:11,257 --> 00:10:15,557
I just pulled out four eyelashes.
That can't be good.

140
00:10:19,332 --> 00:10:21,732
Hey, Paul, here's a tip.

141
00:10:21,901 --> 00:10:26,497
She really likes it when you
rub her neck in the same spot...

142
00:10:26,706 --> 00:10:29,539
...until it starts to get red.

143
00:10:29,743 --> 00:10:33,076
Shut up, Joey!

144
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:35,707
What are you up to tonight?

145
00:10:36,483 --> 00:10:40,214
I was supposed to be headed
for Aruba on my honeymoon...

146
00:10:40,487 --> 00:10:42,819
...so, nothing.

147
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:47,250
Right. You're not even
getting your honeymoon.

148
00:10:47,427 --> 00:10:50,396
Although, Aruba.
This time of year?

149
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:52,928
Talk about your...

150
00:10:53,266 --> 00:10:56,565
...big lizards.

151
00:10:59,205 --> 00:11:01,935
If you don't want
to be alone tonight...

152
00:11:02,108 --> 00:11:05,669
...Joey and Chandler are
helping me with my furniture.

153
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:08,279
We're very excited about it.

154
00:11:08,515 --> 00:11:11,712
Thanks. But I'm just
going to hang out here.

155
00:11:11,918 --> 00:11:13,977
-It's been a long day.
-Oh, sure.

156
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,548
Phoebe, wanna help?

157
00:11:15,989 --> 00:11:19,686
I wish I could,
but I don't want to.

158
00:11:27,701 --> 00:11:33,662
<i>Love is sweet as summer showers
Love is a wondrous work of art</i>

159
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:39,637
<i>But your love
Oh, your love, your love</i>

160
00:11:39,846 --> 00:11:44,249
<i>Is like a giant pigeon</i>

161
00:11:44,451 --> 00:11:48,114
<i>Crapping on my heart</i>

162
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:52,490
Thank you.

163
00:12:01,167 --> 00:12:05,297
I'm supposed to attach a bracket-y
thing to the side things...

164
00:12:05,505 --> 00:12:08,303
...using a bunch of these
little worm guys.

165
00:12:09,743 --> 00:12:14,305
I have no bracket-y thing.
I see no worm guys whatsoever...

166
00:12:14,514 --> 00:12:17,312
...and I cannot feel my legs.

167
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:24,517
-We got a bookcase.
-It's beautiful.

168
00:12:25,058 --> 00:12:26,423
What's this?

169
00:12:26,593 --> 00:12:31,656
I would have to say
that is an L-shaped bracket.

170
00:12:32,031 --> 00:12:36,127
-Which goes where?
-I have no idea.

171
00:12:38,071 --> 00:12:41,302
-Done with the bookcase.
-All finished.

172
00:12:44,544 --> 00:12:47,672
This was Carol's favorite beer.

173
00:12:48,615 --> 00:12:52,517
She always drank it out of the can.
I should have known.

174
00:12:55,955 --> 00:13:01,154
-Start with that, we're out of here.
-Please don't spoil all this fun.

175
00:13:01,361 --> 00:13:02,760
Let me ask you.

176
00:13:02,962 --> 00:13:07,296
She got the furniture,
the stereo, the good TV.

177
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,331
What did you get?

178
00:13:09,536 --> 00:13:12,630
-You guys.
-You got screwed.

179
00:13:12,806 --> 00:13:17,402
-Oh, my God.
-I know. I'm such an idiot.

180
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:22,172
I should've known when she went to
the dentist five times a week.

181
00:13:22,382 --> 00:13:24,714
I mean, how clean can teeth get?

182
00:13:24,918 --> 00:13:27,250
My brother's going through that.

183
00:13:27,453 --> 00:13:28,977
How did you get over it?

184
00:13:29,255 --> 00:13:32,713
He might accidentally
break something valuable of hers.

185
00:13:32,892 --> 00:13:34,519
-Say her...
-Leg?

186
00:13:34,727 --> 00:13:38,629
That's one way of doing it.
I went for the watch.

187
00:13:39,265 --> 00:13:41,790
You actually broke her watch?

188
00:13:42,001 --> 00:13:46,233
The worst I ever did was shred
my old boyfriend's favorite towel.

189
00:13:46,439 --> 00:13:50,000
-Steer clear of you.
-That's right.

190
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:53,579
Barry, I'm sorry.
I am so sorry.

191
00:13:53,847 --> 00:13:59,217
You probably think it's about making
love with your socks on, but it isn't.

192
00:13:59,419 --> 00:14:02,217
It's about me.
And I just...

193
00:14:08,761 --> 00:14:11,787
The machine cut me off again.
Anyway...

194
00:14:16,669 --> 00:14:21,629
...I know that some lucky girl is going
to become Mrs. Barry Finkel.

195
00:14:21,841 --> 00:14:25,572
But it isn't me.
It's not me.

196
00:14:25,778 --> 00:14:30,215
Not that I have any idea who "me" is
right now, but you just...

197
00:14:32,685 --> 00:14:34,243
I'm divorced.

198
00:14:34,454 --> 00:14:41,586
-I'm only 26, and I'm divorced!
-Shut up!

199
00:14:45,231 --> 00:14:47,597
That only took me an hour.

200
00:14:48,601 --> 00:14:54,836
We haven't had a relationship
that's lasted longer than a Mento.

201
00:14:56,576 --> 00:14:59,943
You have had the love of a woman
for four years.

202
00:15:00,146 --> 00:15:05,448
Four years of closeness and sharing,
after which she ripped your heart out.

203
00:15:05,652 --> 00:15:08,644
That is why we don't do it!

204
00:15:09,555 --> 00:15:12,991
I don't think that was my point!

205
00:15:13,192 --> 00:15:17,322
Know what's scary? What if there's
only one woman for everybody?

206
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:20,658
I mean, what if you get one
woman, and that's it?

207
00:15:20,867 --> 00:15:25,804
Unfortunately, in my case,
there was only one woman for her.

208
00:15:27,774 --> 00:15:31,073
What are you talking about?
One woman.

209
00:15:31,744 --> 00:15:35,271
That's like saying there's only
one flavor of ice cream.

210
00:15:35,448 --> 00:15:39,612
Let me tell you something.
There's lots of flavors out there.

211
00:15:39,786 --> 00:15:43,882
Rocky road and cookie dough
and bing cherry vanilla.

212
00:15:44,724 --> 00:15:49,024
You can get them with jimmies
or nuts or whipped cream.

213
00:15:49,495 --> 00:15:52,055
It's the best thing
to happen to you!

214
00:15:52,265 --> 00:15:56,099
You got married.
You were like, what, 8?

215
00:15:57,003 --> 00:16:00,905
Welcome back to the world.
Grab a spoon!

216
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:05,472
-I don't know if I'm hungry or horny.
-Then stay out of my freezer.

217
00:16:09,682 --> 00:16:12,776
Ever since she walked out on me...

218
00:16:13,286 --> 00:16:15,220
What?

219
00:16:15,421 --> 00:16:17,855
You wanna spell it out with noodles?

220
00:16:18,057 --> 00:16:22,790
It's more of a fifth date
kind of revelation.

221
00:16:22,996 --> 00:16:27,490
So there's going to be
a fifth date?

222
00:16:27,667 --> 00:16:29,294
Isn't there?

223
00:16:29,502 --> 00:16:31,732
Yeah, yeah.
I think there is.

224
00:16:33,406 --> 00:16:36,705
What were you going to say?

225
00:16:40,213 --> 00:16:43,376
Ever since she left me...

226
00:16:43,549 --> 00:16:46,347
...I haven't been able to perform...

227
00:16:47,053 --> 00:16:48,884
...sexually.

228
00:16:51,157 --> 00:16:54,092
Oh, God!
I'm so sorry.

229
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:58,697
Being spit on is probably
not what you need right now.

230
00:17:00,233 --> 00:17:01,700
How long?

231
00:17:01,901 --> 00:17:04,995
-Two years.
-Wow.

232
00:17:05,204 --> 00:17:09,072
I'm glad you smashed her watch.

233
00:17:09,976 --> 00:17:14,970
So you still think you might
want that fifth date?

234
00:17:16,482 --> 00:17:20,714
Yeah.
Yeah, I do.

235
00:17:21,254 --> 00:17:26,089
<i>We are gathered here
to join Joanie Louise Cunningham...</i>

236
00:17:26,292 --> 00:17:31,628
<i>...and Charles.
Chachi, Chachi, Chachi...</i>

237
00:17:32,365 --> 00:17:36,461
<i>in the bonds of holy matrimony.</i>

238
00:17:36,702 --> 00:17:37,760
See!

239
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:43,966
But Joanie loved Chachi.
That's the difference.

240
00:17:44,844 --> 00:17:46,675
"Grab a spoon."

241
00:17:46,879 --> 00:17:50,212
Do you know how long it's been
since I grabbed a spoon?

242
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:54,919
Do the words, "Billy, don't be
a hero," mean anything to you?

243
00:17:58,524 --> 00:18:01,618
Great story.
But I gotta go.

244
00:18:01,828 --> 00:18:06,663
I got a date with Andrea.
Angela. No, Andrea.

245
00:18:06,866 --> 00:18:10,267
Andrea's the screamer.
Angela has cats.

246
00:18:10,436 --> 00:18:15,100
Right, thanks. It's Julie.
I'm out of here.

247
00:18:16,676 --> 00:18:20,976
Here's the thing. Even if
I could get it together enough...

248
00:18:21,214 --> 00:18:23,808
...to ask a woman out...

249
00:18:24,016 --> 00:18:25,677
...who am I going to ask?

250
00:18:49,976 --> 00:18:53,605
Isn't this amazing?
I've never made coffee in my life.

251
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:56,312
-That is amazing.
-Congratulations.

252
00:18:56,682 --> 00:19:00,413
If I can make coffee,
there isn't anything I can't do.

253
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:06,151
I think it's, "If I can invade Poland,
there's nothing I can't do."

254
00:19:06,325 --> 00:19:10,989
If you feel like you have to make
a Western omelet or something...

255
00:19:13,933 --> 00:19:17,391
Although, actually
I'm really not that hungry.

256
00:19:18,604 --> 00:19:22,040
Oh, good.
Lenny and Squiggy are here.

257
00:19:22,542 --> 00:19:24,601
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

258
00:19:26,579 --> 00:19:28,479
-Morning.
-Morning, Paul.

259
00:19:28,814 --> 00:19:31,647
-Hello, Paul.
-Hi. Paul, is it?

260
00:19:38,691 --> 00:19:41,660
-Thank you so much.
-Stop.

261
00:19:41,827 --> 00:19:46,355
Last night was like
all my birthdays, both graduations...

262
00:19:46,566 --> 00:19:49,091
...plus the barn-raising scene
in <i>Witness</i>.

263
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:56,406
We'll talk later.

264
00:20:01,647 --> 00:20:03,342
Thank you.

265
00:20:10,423 --> 00:20:13,722
That wasn't a real date.

266
00:20:13,926 --> 00:20:17,157
What the hell do you do
on a real date?

267
00:20:18,197 --> 00:20:21,189
Shut up and put my table back.

268
00:20:21,867 --> 00:20:23,767
I've got to get to work.

269
00:20:23,936 --> 00:20:29,465
If I don't input those numbers,
it doesn't make much of a difference.

270
00:20:32,511 --> 00:20:35,105
So, like, you guys all have jobs?

271
00:20:36,349 --> 00:20:40,911
Yeah, we all have jobs.
That's how we buy stuff.

272
00:20:43,055 --> 00:20:47,185
-Yeah, I'm an actor.
-Have I seen you in anything?

273
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,726
I doubt it.
Mostly regional work.

274
00:20:49,929 --> 00:20:53,387
Unless you saw the Wee One's
production of <i>Pinocchio</i>...

275
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:56,397
...at the little theater
in the park?

276
00:20:56,802 --> 00:20:58,133
It was a job!

277
00:20:58,504 --> 00:21:01,132
"Look, Geppetto.
I'm a real live boy."

278
00:21:03,909 --> 00:21:07,675
-I will not take this abuse.
-You're right, I'm sorry.

279
00:21:07,947 --> 00:21:10,609
<i>Once I was a wooden boy
A little wooden boy</i>

280
00:21:13,052 --> 00:21:17,250
You should both know
that he's a dead man.

281
00:21:17,423 --> 00:21:19,391
Oh, Chandler!

282
00:21:21,827 --> 00:21:24,125
How are you doing today?
Sleep okay?

283
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:28,232
Did you talk to Barry?
I can't stop smiling.

284
00:21:28,434 --> 00:21:32,962
I see that. You look like you
slept with a hanger in your mouth.

285
00:21:37,643 --> 00:21:40,771
I know.
He's just so...

286
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,010
-Remember you and Tony Demarco?
-Oh, yeah.

287
00:21:44,216 --> 00:21:47,947
Well, it's like that.
With feelings.

288
00:21:48,821 --> 00:21:51,790
-Wow, are you in trouble!
-Big time!

289
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:55,556
Want a wedding dress?
Hardly used.

290
00:21:55,761 --> 00:21:59,322
I think we're getting a little
ahead of ourselves.

291
00:21:59,532 --> 00:22:04,162
I'm going to get up, go to work,
and not think about him all day.

292
00:22:05,104 --> 00:22:08,005
Or else I'm going to get up
and go to work.

293
00:22:08,207 --> 00:22:09,868
-Wish me luck!
-What for?

294
00:22:10,042 --> 00:22:14,445
I'm gonna go get one
of those job things.

295
00:22:24,623 --> 00:22:27,057
-Hi, Monica.
-Franny, welcome back.

296
00:22:27,293 --> 00:22:30,456
-How was Florida?
-You had sex, didn't you?

297
00:22:32,498 --> 00:22:34,728
-How do you do that?
-I hate you.

298
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:38,927
I'm pushing my aunt through
Parrot Jungle, you're having sex.

299
00:22:39,105 --> 00:22:42,268
So, who?

300
00:22:42,641 --> 00:22:44,131
You know Paul?

301
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:47,777
Paul, the wine guy?
Yeah, I know Paul.

302
00:22:50,316 --> 00:22:52,841
You mean, you know Paul
like I know Paul?

303
00:22:53,018 --> 00:22:55,111
What?
I take credit for Paul.

304
00:22:55,321 --> 00:22:59,621
Before me, there was no snap in his
turtle for two years.

305
00:23:02,895 --> 00:23:05,455
Of course it was a line.

306
00:23:05,798 --> 00:23:08,528
Why would anybody
do something like that?

307
00:23:08,701 --> 00:23:11,966
I assume we want an answer
more sophisticated than:

308
00:23:12,138 --> 00:23:15,073
"To get you into bed."

309
00:23:15,274 --> 00:23:17,606
I hate men.

310
00:23:17,777 --> 00:23:21,907
Don't hate. You don't want
to put that out into the universe.

311
00:23:22,214 --> 00:23:23,545
Is it me?

312
00:23:23,816 --> 00:23:27,445
Is it like I have some sort of
beacon that only dogs...

313
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:30,316
...and men with emotional problems
can hear?

314
00:23:30,489 --> 00:23:33,788
Come here.
Give me your feet.

315
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:43,024
I just thought he was nice, you know?

316
00:23:46,272 --> 00:23:50,333
I can't believe
you didn't know it was a line.

317
00:23:53,746 --> 00:23:55,611
-Guess what?
-You got a job?

318
00:23:55,781 --> 00:24:00,081
Are you kidding?
I'm trained for nothing.

319
00:24:00,352 --> 00:24:04,311
-I was laughed out of 12 interviews.
-You're surprisingly upbeat.

320
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:07,755
You'd be too,
if you found these boots on sale...

321
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,951
...50% off.

322
00:24:10,129 --> 00:24:13,189
How well you know me.

323
00:24:14,333 --> 00:24:16,858
They're my
"I don't need a job...

324
00:24:17,069 --> 00:24:19,128
...I've got great boots" boots.

325
00:24:20,539 --> 00:24:22,734
-How did you pay?
-Credit card.

326
00:24:23,275 --> 00:24:25,937
And who pays for that?

327
00:24:26,212 --> 00:24:28,942
My father.

328
00:24:31,717 --> 00:24:35,244
Is this really necessary?
I can stop charging any time.

329
00:24:35,454 --> 00:24:37,684
You can't live off your parents.

330
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:41,621
I know that.
That's why I was getting married.

331
00:24:42,294 --> 00:24:45,422
Give her a break.
It's hard being on your own.

332
00:24:45,664 --> 00:24:46,653
Thank you.

333
00:24:46,832 --> 00:24:50,359
I remember when I first
came to this city, I was 14.

334
00:24:50,569 --> 00:24:53,436
Mom had killed herself,
stepdad was in jail.

335
00:24:53,639 --> 00:24:55,664
I didn't know anybody here.

336
00:24:55,875 --> 00:25:00,471
I ended up living with this albino
guy who was cleaning windshields.

337
00:25:00,679 --> 00:25:02,476
And then he killed himself.

338
00:25:02,681 --> 00:25:07,345
Then I found aromatherapy.
So I know exactly how you feel.

339
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:13,250
The word you're looking for is:

340
00:25:13,926 --> 00:25:16,360
"Anyway..."

341
00:25:20,366 --> 00:25:24,132
-You ready?
-No, how can I be ready?

342
00:25:24,303 --> 00:25:27,204
"Ready to jump out of the plane
with no parachute?"

343
00:25:27,373 --> 00:25:29,603
-I can't do this.
-I know you can.

344
00:25:29,808 --> 00:25:32,902
-No.
-You made coffee, you can do anything.

345
00:25:35,481 --> 00:25:38,416
Cut. Cut. Cut.

346
00:25:43,522 --> 00:25:47,083
You know what?
I think we can leave it at that.

347
00:25:47,293 --> 00:25:51,354
-Kind of a symbolic gesture.
-Rachel, that was a library card.

348
00:25:58,037 --> 00:26:02,906
If you listen closely, you can hear
a thousand retailers scream.

349
00:26:06,111 --> 00:26:07,772
Welcome to the real world!

350
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:11,211
It sucks.
You're gonna love it.

351
00:26:19,124 --> 00:26:22,184
That's it.
Are you going to crash on the couch?

352
00:26:22,361 --> 00:26:26,525
-No, I gotta go home sometime.
-Are you gonna be okay?

353
00:26:28,334 --> 00:26:31,667
Look what I just
found on the floor.

354
00:26:32,571 --> 00:26:34,095
What?

355
00:26:34,306 --> 00:26:38,037
That's Paul's watch.
Just put it back where you found it.

356
00:26:39,712 --> 00:26:41,873
Oh, boy!
All right.

357
00:26:42,314 --> 00:26:45,647
-Good night, everybody.
-Good night.

358
00:26:55,694 --> 00:27:00,597
-I'm sorry. Have it, I don't want it.
-Split it?

359
00:27:04,837 --> 00:27:08,295
You probably didn't know this,
but in high school...

360
00:27:08,674 --> 00:27:11,165
...I had a major crush on you.

361
00:27:12,478 --> 00:27:13,843
I knew.

362
00:27:14,013 --> 00:27:17,073
You did?

363
00:27:17,349 --> 00:27:20,876
I figured you thought
I was Monica's geeky brother.

364
00:27:21,086 --> 00:27:23,145
I did.

365
00:27:27,793 --> 00:27:29,385
Listen, do you think...?

366
00:27:29,595 --> 00:27:34,589
Try not to let my vulnerability
become a factor here.

367
00:27:35,234 --> 00:27:39,364
Do you think it would be okay
if I asked you out sometime?

368
00:27:40,272 --> 00:27:42,433
Yeah.

369
00:27:42,641 --> 00:27:43,972
Maybe.

370
00:27:44,877 --> 00:27:48,176
Okay.

371
00:27:51,583 --> 00:27:53,517
Okay, maybe I will.

372
00:27:57,856 --> 00:28:01,257
-Good night.
-Good night.

373
00:28:14,339 --> 00:28:16,569
See you.

374
00:28:17,876 --> 00:28:20,367
Wait, wait.
What's with you?

375
00:28:22,981 --> 00:28:27,281
I just grabbed a spoon.

376
00:28:33,392 --> 00:28:37,556
-I can't believe what I'm hearing.
-<i>Can't believe what I'm hearing</i>

377
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:39,960
-What? I said...
-<i>What? I said...</i>

378
00:28:40,966 --> 00:28:43,491
-Would you stop?
-Was I doing it again?

379
00:28:43,669 --> 00:28:45,967
Yes!

380
00:28:46,271 --> 00:28:50,708
I said you had a nice butt.
It's just not a great butt.

381
00:28:50,876 --> 00:28:55,108
-You won't know a butt if it bit you.
-There's an image.

382
00:28:57,583 --> 00:29:00,848
Would anybody like more coffee?

383
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:04,050
You made it,
or you're serving it?

384
00:29:04,256 --> 00:29:07,851
-I'm just serving it.
-I'll have a cup of coffee.

385
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:09,527
Kids, new dream.

386
00:29:09,695 --> 00:29:10,957
I'm in Las Vegas.

387
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:13,758
Miss, more coffee?

388
00:29:14,166 --> 00:29:17,897
Could you give this
to that guy over there?

389
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:21,234
Go ahead.
Thank you.

390
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,170
Sorry.
Okay, Las Vegas.

391
00:29:24,376 --> 00:29:26,469
I'm in Las Vegas.

392
00:29:27,379 --> 00:29:29,745
I'm Liza Minnelli...

393
00:29:30,305 --> 00:29:36,751
